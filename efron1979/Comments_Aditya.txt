Feedback on Ziang's presentation on Efron (1979):

- I appreciate how Ziang used simple examples to explain the core concepts of Bootstrap. 

- When discussing Bootstrap's popularity, I suggest highlighting its fully automated nature, which spares us the burden of case-by-case calculations typically required in maximum likelihood estimation. 

- Adding visual aids, such as histograms, would enhance the presentation by illustrating the theoretical proof sketches.
