 1. It would be nice to know in what sense the jackknife fails to estimate the median and how large the failure is.  Why does the bootstrap fix the median estimation problem?

2. There was an anecdote in the presentation about pulling oneself up by one's bootstraps.  This is obviously impossible; I'd be interested to know more about the history behind this name. 
  
3.  Did people initially think that you were somehow getting something for nothing with the bootstrap?
  
4. There wasn't much discussion about limitations of the bootstrap (besides that it's computationally taxing).  
  
 5.  Are there limitations or statistics for which the bootstrap will not give good estimates of the variance?
