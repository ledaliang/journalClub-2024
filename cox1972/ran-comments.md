Feedback for Josh and Ivy:

- I liked how you discussed previous methodologies, and the advantages and limitations of the proportioanl harzards model proposed in this paper.
I also really liked your discussion on subsequent methodologies that the proportioanl harzards model inspired,
e.g., the stratified Cox model, random survival forests, etc.

- It might be helpful to discuss how to assess goodness-of-fit of the proportioanl harzards model.

- It migth also be helpful to give a summary table of the packages and software developed to implement the proportioanl harzards model.
